# Miles-Gmail-Unsubscribe
A Google Apps Script that will unsubscribe from emails labeled "unsubscribe". This was developed partially by ChatGPT.

## Setup

1. Apply a Label named "Unsubscribe" to any emails in gmail 
2. Go to https://script.google.com/home. 
3. Click "+ New Project". You may need to agree to terms of use, etc.
4. Replace the default function with the code in Miles-Gmail-Unsubscribe.gs.
5. Replace the "Untitled project" with a name of your choosing.
6. Click Run.
7. If you'd like to schedule this to run hourly you can add a trigger to it on the left hand side. That way you can just label emails as unsubscribe and forget about it.
